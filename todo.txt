Todo
1 - read in list of usernames
2 - check they all can be called with temple osrs api first
3 - decide good stats to check for
4 - create data structures for each player / teams
5 - decide weighting for player stats to score players
6 - check these scores all make sense, allow for manual override for outliers
7 - make team deciding algorithm (T teams)
    7.1 - strongest T players are 'captains', index these in order chosen
    7.2 - from last to to first, sort next T strongest players into teams
    7.3 - from first to last, sort next T strongest players into teams
    7.4 - repeat from 7.2 until finished
8 - check if teams make sense, printing team list and final score

- just read in names
- output csv with scores, set manual scores to 0
- this is so i can set a flag to read in names or read in names+data csv, so no need to keep calling temple
